#ofxLeapGestures

This is a work in progress addon for training and recognizing hand gestures with the Leap Motion Controller and the Gesture Recognition Toolkit (GRT). 

Its development was prompted by our work being done on the <a href="https://github.com/cmuartfab/dranimate">Dranimate</a> animation system.

In the future this might become a generic wrapper for GRT with support for many other devices!
